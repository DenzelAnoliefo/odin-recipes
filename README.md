# odin-recipes

odin recipes is a website currently constructed entirely using only HTML5 that consists of some of my favourite recipes. 

Through this project, I learned and practiced my HTML fundamentals. Basic concepts such as inserting images, links, lists, etc. 

Later on, I'll be updating and styling the website using CSS.
