# odin-recipes

odin recipes is a website currently constructed entirely using only HTML5 that consists of some of my favourite recipes. 

Through this project, I learned and practiced my HTML fundamentals. Basic concepts such as inserting images, links, lists, etc. 

Later on, I'll be updating this project using CSS and further down the line in my learning journey using JavaScript.
